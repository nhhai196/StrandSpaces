COMPLETED
(these are proven and labeled in the given file)

** Strand Space General Theorems
***[X] Lemma 2.7a | partial order of edges in a bundle
***[X] Lemma 2.7b | non-empty subsets of bundle's nodes have edge-minimal members
***[X] Lemma 2.8 | minimal members are tx-ers
***[X] Lemma 2.9 | originating node for subterms
***[X] Proposition 2.12 | encrypted subterms
** Penetrator Theorems
***[] Proposition 3.3 | non-penetrator keys that are not broadcast are never subterms

IN PROGRESS
(this is the next theorem to be proven)
